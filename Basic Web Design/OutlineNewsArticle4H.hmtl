</head>
<body>
<h1> Why sign up? </h1>
<p> 4H is a great program to help kids learn how they can be successful and impact the world around them.  There are many club options available depending on the child’s interests.  Some club options include Teen Council, Equine, Beef, Fashion Design, Civic Engagement, Cooking, Arts and Crafts, and many more!  Meetings are held on average 2 times per month. </p>
<blockquote>
A member of the Equine club states that she, “loves getting to make new friends who share the same interests as me.”

<h2> How to Sign Up </h2>
<p> If you are interested in getting signed up for 4H, you will need to create an account in ZSuites.  Once you have done this, you may pick the club(s) of your choice.  If you are unsure of if you want to be a part of a club or not, contact the leader whose name and number are listed with the club icon for more information. </p>
<strong>
The deadline for signups is March 31st so don’t delay!
<strong/>
<h3> How you can Help </h3>
If you want to help out the 4H program, there are a few ways you can do this.  One option is to sign up to be a leader of a club.  If you do not want a major time commitment like this, you could volunteer as a guest speaker at one of the club meetings.  Also, donations are always appreciated to keep the clubs going strong! </p>
